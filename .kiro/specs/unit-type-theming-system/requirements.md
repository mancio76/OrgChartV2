# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current orgchart system has hardcoded styling and logic for unit types (specifically unit_type_id == 1 vs unit_type_id == 2), which limits flexibility and scalability. This feature introduces a comprehensive theming system that allows dynamic customization of unit type appearance and behavior through a dedicated `unit_type_themes` table, eliminating all hardcoded values and enabling unlimited unit type customization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to define visual themes for unit types through a database-driven configuration system, so that I can customize the appearance of different organizational units without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new unit type theme THEN the system SHALL store theme configuration including colors, icons, borders, and display properties
2. WHEN I assign a theme to a unit type THEN all units of that type SHALL automatically use the theme's visual properties
3. WHEN I update a theme THEN all associated unit types SHALL immediately reflect the changes across all views
4. IF no theme is assigned to a unit type THEN the system SHALL use a default theme configuration
5. WHEN I delete a theme THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion if any unit types are using it OR reassign to default theme

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all template logic to be driven by theme data instead of hardcoded unit_type_id comparisons, so that the system can support unlimited unit types with custom styling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering orgchart templates THEN the system SHALL use theme data for icon selection, colors, and CSS classes
2. WHEN displaying unit badges THEN the system SHALL use theme-defined labels instead of hardcoded text
3. WHEN applying CSS styling THEN the system SHALL generate dynamic classes based on theme configuration
4. WHEN showing unit emojis THEN the system SHALL use theme-defined fallback emojis
5. WHEN hovering over units THEN the system SHALL apply theme-specific hover effects

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a UI designer, I want to create reusable themes that can be shared across multiple unit types, so that I can maintain visual consistency and reduce configuration duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a theme THEN multiple unit types SHALL be able to reference the same theme
2. WHEN I modify a shared theme THEN all unit types using that theme SHALL reflect the changes
3. WHEN I create a new unit type THEN I SHALL be able to select from existing themes or create a new one
4. WHEN viewing theme usage THEN the system SHALL show which unit types are using each theme
5. WHEN I want to duplicate a theme THEN the system SHALL provide a clone functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the orgchart visualization to maintain all current functionality while supporting the new theming system, so that existing workflows are preserved with enhanced customization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the orgchart tree THEN all current visual elements SHALL be preserved but driven by theme data
2. WHEN comparing units THEN theme-based styling SHALL be applied consistently
3. WHEN viewing unit details THEN theme colors and icons SHALL be displayed correctly
4. WHEN printing or exporting THEN theme styling SHALL be maintained in output
5. WHEN using accessibility features THEN theme colors SHALL meet contrast requirements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want the new theming system to integrate seamlessly with existing data structures, so that migration is smooth and data integrity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating existing data THEN current unit types SHALL be automatically assigned appropriate themes
2. WHEN the system starts THEN foreign key relationships SHALL be properly maintained
3. WHEN backing up data THEN theme configurations SHALL be included in database exports
4. WHEN restoring data THEN theme relationships SHALL be correctly restored
5. WHEN validating data THEN theme references SHALL be checked for consistency

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to manage unit type themes through an administrative interface, so that I can customize the system without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access theme management THEN I SHALL see a list of all available themes with preview
2. WHEN I create a new theme THEN I SHALL have form fields for all customizable properties
3. WHEN I edit a theme THEN I SHALL see a live preview of changes
4. WHEN I assign themes to unit types THEN I SHALL have a clear interface showing current assignments
5. WHEN I validate theme settings THEN the system SHALL check for valid colors, icons, and CSS values
