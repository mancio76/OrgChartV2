# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive data import and export system for the organigramma web application. The system will support CSV and JSON file formats while respecting foreign key dependencies and maintaining data integrity. The import process will handle the correct order of entity creation (Unit Types → Unit Type Themes → Units → Job Titles → Persons → Assignments) to ensure referential integrity. The export functionality will maintain the same dependency-aware behavior, allowing for complete data backup and migration scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to import organizational data from CSV or JSON files, so that I can bulk load data into the system efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload a CSV or JSON file THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and structure
2. WHEN importing data THEN the system SHALL process entities in dependency order: Unit Types, Unit Type Themes, Units, Job Titles, Persons, Assignments
3. WHEN a foreign key reference is missing THEN the system SHALL report the error and skip that record
4. WHEN import is successful THEN the system SHALL provide a summary report of imported records
5. IF import fails THEN the system SHALL rollback all changes and provide detailed error information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to export organizational data to CSV or JSON files, so that I can backup data or migrate to other systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request data export THEN the system SHALL generate files in dependency order
2. WHEN exporting to CSV THEN the system SHALL create separate files for each entity type
3. WHEN exporting to JSON THEN the system SHALL create a single structured file with all entities
4. WHEN export is complete THEN the system SHALL provide downloadable files
5. WHEN exporting assignments THEN the system SHALL include version history data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to preview import data before committing changes, so that I can verify the data integrity before applying changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload an import file THEN the system SHALL provide a preview of records to be imported
2. WHEN previewing THEN the system SHALL show validation results for each record
3. WHEN previewing THEN the system SHALL highlight foreign key relationships and dependencies
4. WHEN I confirm the preview THEN the system SHALL proceed with the actual import
5. IF I cancel the preview THEN the system SHALL discard the uploaded data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to handle duplicate records during import, so that I can choose how to resolve conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicate records are detected THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution options
2. WHEN I choose "skip duplicates" THEN the system SHALL ignore existing records
3. WHEN I choose "update existing" THEN the system SHALL update records with new data
4. WHEN I choose "create new version" THEN the system SHALL create new versions for assignments
5. WHEN conflicts are resolved THEN the system SHALL continue with the import process

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to import partial datasets, so that I can update specific entity types without affecting others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select specific entity types for import THEN the system SHALL only process those entities
2. WHEN importing partial data THEN the system SHALL still validate foreign key dependencies
3. WHEN partial import is successful THEN the system SHALL report only on imported entity types
4. WHEN partial import fails THEN the system SHALL rollback only the affected entity types
5. IF dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL warn about incomplete relationships

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to schedule automated exports, so that I can maintain regular backups of organizational data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure export schedules THEN the system SHALL support daily, weekly, and monthly intervals
2. WHEN scheduled export runs THEN the system SHALL generate files automatically
3. WHEN export is complete THEN the system SHALL store files in a designated backup location
4. WHEN export fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and notify administrators
5. WHEN storage space is limited THEN the system SHALL rotate old backup files

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to track import/export operations, so that I can monitor data transfer activities and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN import/export operations run THEN the system SHALL log all activities
2. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL record success/failure status
3. WHEN viewing operation history THEN the system SHALL show timestamps, user, and file details
4. WHEN operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error logs
5. WHEN I need to audit changes THEN the system SHALL link imports to created/modified records
